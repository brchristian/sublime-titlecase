The title case function that currently ships with Sublime capitalizes the first letter of every word regardless of context or size. This plugin adds a Smart Title Case command that wraps Stuart Colville's [Python implementation](http://muffinresearch.co.uk/archives/2008/05/27/titlecasepy-titlecase-in-python/) of John Gruber's [Title Case](http://daringfireball.net/2008/05/title_case).
